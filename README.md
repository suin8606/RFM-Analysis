What is RFM Analysis?
RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis is a marketing technique used to determine quantitatively which customers are the best ones by examining how recently a customer has purchased (recency), how often they purchase (frequency), and how much the customer spends (monetary).


* Recency: How recent was the customer's last purchase? Customers who recetnly made a purchase will still have products on their mind and they are more likely to purcahse or use the product again. Business often measures recency in days, but depending on the product, they may measure it in years, weeks or even hours.

* Frequency: How often did the customer make a purchase in a given period? Customers who purchased once are often more likely to purchase again. Additionally, first time customer may be good tartgets for follow-up advertising to convert them into more frequent customers.

* Monetary: How much money did the customer spend in a given period? Customers who spend a lot of money are more likely to spend money in the future and have a high value to a business.
